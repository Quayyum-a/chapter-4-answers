4.10 Similarities:
		a) They are both control structures
		b) They both require a condition to determine wether to run a block of code
		c) They both use comparison operators
	  Differences:
	   a) if is a single selection statement which will execute a block of code if the condition is true
		b) while is a loop that executes a block of code as far as the condition remains true
		c) if checks the condition only once then run the code
		d) while checks the condition and runs the code and goes back to check the condition again
		
4.11 When dividing 2 integers the fractional part is truncated , you can avoid the outcome by using double or float points

4.12 (a) nested control statement
     (b) sequential execution
	  
4.13 (a) use a while loop or do-while loop because the number of repetitions is unknown
     (b) use a for loop because the number of repitition is fixed
	  
4.14 (a) the value of x is 5

4.15 (a)if (age >= 65);
				System.out.println("Age is greater than or equal to 65");

		(b)int x = 1;
		   int total = 0;
			while (x <= 10) {

		(c) while (x <= 100){
			total += x;
			++x;
		}
		(d) while (y != 0){
			System.out.println(y)
		}
